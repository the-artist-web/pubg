<p align="center">PUBG, short for PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, is a popular online multiplayer battle royale game developed and published by PUBG Corporation, a subsidiary of South Korean video game company Bluehole. In PUBG, up to 100 players parachute onto an island and scavenge for weapons and equipment to kill others while avoiding getting killed themselves. The game's safe area decreases in size over time, forcing players into closer quarters and creating intense battles. The last player or team standing wins the round. PUBG has been praised for its realistic graphics, immersive gameplay, and intense multiplayer action. => was created using languages HTML CSS JS</p>
